# PMC-Patients
This repository contains PMC-Patients dataset (including patient notes, patient-patient similarity annotations, patient-article relevance annotations, and four downstream task datasets: patient note recognition PNR, patient-patient similarity PPS, patient-patient retrieval PPR, and patient-article retrieval PAR), codes for collection datasets and several baseline models.

[See our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13876.pdf).

## PMC OA and PubMed Downloads
For those who only wish to reproduce baseline models, only PubMed abstracts are required for PAR task.

If you have already downloaded PMC OA and PubMed abstracts on your device, skip this step and change relative directory in later steps. Otherwise, download [PMC OA](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_bulk/) and [PubMed](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). Note that file `PMC-ids.csv` under [this directory](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/) is also required.

## Dataset
PMC-Patients dataset can be downloaded via [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFCLy_CF8fxPDZvDtHPR6Dl6x9l0TyvW/view?usp=sharing) without any data usage agreement. After downloading, please unzip it and put `datasets` and `meta_data` under this directory.

For dataset details, see `README.md` in `datasets` and `meta_data` directory.

All articles used in PMC-Patients are credited in `meta_data/PMC-Patients_citations.json`.

### Dataset Version Logs
Generally **PMC-Patients** will only be updated incrementally when new data are ready to release, so there's no need to keep an old version and the download link would stay the same.

- `v1.2`: Add `PMC-Patients_human.json` of ground-truth patient notes and their demographics annotated by experts.
- `v1.1`: Add citations of articles used in **PMC-Patients**.

## Code
To reproduce construction of PMC-Patients, see `code/PMC-Patients_collection/`. To try our baselines, see `code/downstream_task/`.
